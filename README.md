This is a collection of functions to batch-process whole-cell patch-clamp data generated by pClamp (.abf binary files).

It uses [pyabf](https://pypi.org/project/pyabf/) to read the files, all processing is done with R/tidyverse.
The functions will detect and extract features from action potentials as well as perform some basic time-course fitting on voltage-clamp data (K-current relaxations).
